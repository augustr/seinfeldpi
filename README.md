# Raspberry Pi Seinfeld Door Sensor

## Overview

This python script senses a door open/close on GPIO pin 4 and play a random bass solo if you have a selection of seinfeld bass solos as .wav files in a audio/ subfolder.

## How it works

* Connect to the Pi something that opens the circuit between GPIO pin 4 and ground when a door opens.
* Gather some .wav files and place in audio/ subfolder
* Run seinfeld.py as root
* Enjoy!
